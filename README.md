The simulation of genetic data under spatially-explicit evolutionary models was performed with the software Splatche (http://www.splatche.com/). We include here the specific version of Splatche used for this study, including executable files for Windows (SplatcheWin.exe) and Linux (SplatcheLinux). For further information about Splatche and its application we refer to http://www.splatche.com/

The estimation of genetic gradients under PCA was performed with an R script that is provided upon request (marenas@uvigo.es / miguelmmmab@gmail.com).

A copy of the license is also distributed. Detailed information to run the script is included at the beginning of the script.
